How fast do your users think your site is, really?  How fast should it be?  How do you get there?

== Description ==

There's no question that web and mobile application performance affects user behavior â€” but how do you put that information to good use?

Using Real User Monitoring (RUM), Akamai's mPulse captures and aggregates the performance and engagement metrics most important to your business in real time, giving you the real user intelligence needed to correlate the impact of performance on the bottom line, take immediate action as required, and feed critical information back into the development lifecycle.

All data is presented to you in a vivid, easy-to-understand and actionable format.
